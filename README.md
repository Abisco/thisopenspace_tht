# Abbass-Ali Siwjees Take Home Test for thisopenspace
Created using create-react-app, this application was created with the following specifications in mind:
* Grabbing and presenting data from the test API: https://thisopenspace.com/lhl-test?page=x (where x is the page number)
* Implement pagination of infinite scrolling to show only some listings at a time
* Marked on code readability, maintainability, functionality, and library choices

## Implementation
The application was (as mentioned before) created using create-react-app in order to quickly get started with development. I also used Semantic UI and Axios in order to grab and present the data. 

## Notes
The application took me about 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete as well as 10 minutes before-hand for research which included:
* Looking through the API
* Looking through old code I had written for side projects for how I would go about implementing things
* Looking through semantic UI components to find the ones that would best present the data.
